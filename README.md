## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Handlebars

### What I learned

I used this project to familiarize myself more with the use of Express and Handlebars. I used Express on top of Node to manage my routing and reading post body data. I used Handlebars to add the data read from the body to the page of the result.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1xa8Bsho6A] - Before using Express, I learned a lot from this video of setting up a REST API using Vanilla Node.JS Coming to an understanding of how requests and responses were managed by node with http module made me more comfortable when using Express which is built on top of Node.
